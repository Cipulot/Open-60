## Required-Hardware

- Everything from the "[case-files](https://github.com/ojthetiny/Open-60/tree/main/case-files)" directory.
- A PCB of your choosing. I recommend the [SST60](https://github.com/dededecline/SST60), however any Bakeneko supporting PCB should work.
- A Unified Daughterboard or equivalent (like the hiney DB).
- Screws:
    - 4 M3x10mm screws with a 5.5mm head diameter. [These](https://www.mcmaster.com/92290A115/) for example.
    - 4 M3x8mm screws with a 5.5mm head diameter and <2mm head height. [These](https://www.mcmaster.com/90666A104/) for example.
    - 3 M3x6mm countersunk screws with a 5.5mm head diameter. [These](https://www.mcmaster.com/90236A119) for example.
    - 10 M2x6mm screws with a <2mm head diameter. [These](https://www.mcmaster.com/92290A013) for example.
- SKUF Feet.
- Optional: 
    - O-ring for gasket mounting. Like [This 50a one](https://www.mcmaster.com/1173N502/), or [this 70a one](https://www.mcmaster.com/9452K362/), or [this 90a one](https://www.mcmaster.com/5308T32/).
    - Any type of foam you might want. (I will judge you.)
